# The 240 IPIP-HEXACO items and their keys

The items of
[hexaco_real](https://www.okanbulut.com/mirtverse/reference/hexaco_real.md)
and
[hexaco_llm](https://www.okanbulut.com/mirtverse/reference/hexaco_llm.md)
in their original order, with the trait and facet each one measures and
whether it is reverse-keyed. Each of the six traits has four facets of
10 items; 122 items are reverse-keyed.

## Usage

``` r
hexaco_items
```

## Format

A data frame with 240 rows and 7 columns: `item` (column name in the
response data), `trait` (`H`, `E`, `X`, `A`, `C` or `O`), `trait_label`
(for example `Honesty-Humility`), `facet` and `facet_label` (for example
`HSinc` and `Sincerity`), `statement` (the item text) and `reverse`
(`TRUE` for reverse-keyed items).
