# How well do synthetic respondents cover the real population?

**Experimental.** `synthetic_coverage()` compares synthetic respondents
from one or more language models (for example from
[`simulate_llm_respondents()`](https://www.okanbulut.com/mirtverse/reference/simulate_llm_respondents.md),
run several times) with real responses to the same items, and finds the
blend of models that matches the real population best.
[`gg_coverage()`](https://www.okanbulut.com/mirtverse/reference/gg_coverage.md)
draws the result as a *coverage strip*: One row per model and attempt,
one column per slice of the real population, coloured by whether the
model puts too many (blue) or too few (red) synthetic respondents in
that slice.

## Usage

``` r
synthetic_coverage(
  synthetic,
  real = NULL,
  slices = c("score", "theta", "group", "item"),
  group = NULL,
  within_group = FALSE,
  target = NULL,
  model = NULL,
  n_slices = 10,
  conf = 0.95,
  cor = c("auto", "polychoric", "pearson"),
  blend = TRUE,
  holdout = NULL,
  step = 0.05,
  seed = 1
)
```

## Arguments

- synthetic:

  a named list with one element per language model. Each element holds
  that model's attempts: A list of response data frames or
  [`simulate_llm_respondents()`](https://www.okanbulut.com/mirtverse/reference/simulate_llm_respondents.md)
  results, one per attempt (a single data frame or result counts as one
  attempt).

- real:

  a data frame of real responses to the same items (columns matched by
  name). Can be `NULL` with `slices = "group"` and `target`.

- slices:

  what the columns of the strip are: `"score"`, `"theta"`, `"group"` or
  `"item"` (see Details).

- group:

  optional name of a column that holds the group or persona of each
  respondent, in `real` and in the synthetic data (or in the `personas`
  of a
  [`simulate_llm_respondents()`](https://www.okanbulut.com/mirtverse/reference/simulate_llm_respondents.md)
  result).

- within_group:

  with `group` and `slices = "score"` or `"theta"`, compare the shares
  within each group, so that the mix of groups does not count (see
  Details)?

- target:

  with `slices = "group"` and no real data, the intended share of each
  group: A named vector of proportions.

- model:

  with `slices = "theta"`, an optional unidimensional model from
  [`mirt::mirt()`](https://philchalmers.github.io/mirt/reference/mirt.html)
  fitted to the real data.

- n_slices:

  number of score or theta slices (per group with `group`).

- conf:

  confidence level for the noise check.

- cor:

  correlations for the structure check: `"auto"`, `"polychoric"` or
  `"pearson"`.

- blend:

  find the best blend of the models?

- holdout:

  choose the blend on half of the attempts and report it on the other
  half? `NULL` does so when every model has four or more attempts.

- step:

  grid step for the blend weights.

- seed:

  random seed for the pooled sample behind a blend's structure.

## Value

An object of class `mv_coverage`: A list with `summary` (a tibble with
one row per model, and one for the blend, giving the Overall, Lowest and
Highest overlap and structure over the attempts), `cells` (the synthetic
and real share in every slice for every model and attempt), `attempts`
(overlap and structure of every attempt), `blend` (weights, recipe and
the attempts used), `slices` (the slice definitions) and `notes`. It has
[`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html),
[`tidy()`](https://generics.r-lib.org/reference/tidy.html) and
[`autoplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/autoplot.html)
methods.

## Details

**Slices.** By default (`slices = "score"`) the slices are the deciles
of the real total score, so each holds about 10% of real people (ties in
the score can make them uneven; when the score has `n_slices` values or
fewer, each value is its own slice). `slices = "theta"` uses deciles of
EAP scores from a unidimensional model fitted to the real data (or the
model given as `model`). `slices = "group"` uses the groups in the
column named by `group` (for example personas), and `slices = "item"`
switches to item mode: One column per item for right/wrong items, or one
column per answer category for polytomous (for example Likert) items.
With `group` and `slices = "score"` or `"theta"`, the deciles are formed
within each group. By default the shares are then taken over all
respondents, so the mix of groups counts too: A model with too few
respondents from one group shows red across that group's slices. With
`within_group = TRUE` the shares are taken within each group instead, so
only how each group's respondents spread over that group's slices
counts, and Overlap is the mean over the groups. Use it when the number
of synthetic respondents per group was set by design (for example the
same number for each country) and does not need to match the real data.

**Overlap** is the share of synthetic respondents (or answers) that fall
in the same slices as real ones: The sum over slices of the smaller of
the synthetic and the real share, which is one minus the total variation
distance. In item mode it is computed for each item and averaged over
the items (*Item Overlap*). 100% means the same mix as the real data.

**Structure** is 100% minus the mean absolute difference between the
inter-item correlations of the real and the synthetic responses
(polychoric correlations when the polycor package is installed and
`cor = "auto"`, otherwise Pearson correlations). It catches synthetic
data that match every slice but relate the items to each other in a
different way.

**Noise.** A cell is coloured only when the gap between the synthetic
and the real share is larger than a real sample of the same size would
show by chance (outside the `conf` interval of a binomial proportion);
all other cells are drawn as a match.

**Best Blend.** With two or more models and `blend = TRUE`, the function
searches a grid of weights (steps of `step`) for the recipe whose
mixture of synthetic respondents has the highest overlap: A blend's
share in a slice is the weighted sum of the models' shares. With four or
more attempts per model (or `holdout = TRUE`), the recipe is chosen on
the first half of the attempts and its numbers are reported on the other
half, so that it is not judged on the data it was chosen on. The
structure of a blend is computed on a pooled sample drawn with the
recipe's weights. See
[`blend_llms()`](https://www.okanbulut.com/mirtverse/reference/blend_llms.md)
to search again with other settings.

Synthetic respondents are experimental: Use the coverage strip to
compare models and to decide how to combine them, not to replace a field
test.
