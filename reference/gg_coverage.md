# Draw the coverage strip

Draws an
[`synthetic_coverage()`](https://www.okanbulut.com/mirtverse/reference/synthetic_coverage.md)
result: One row per model and attempt (and the Best Blend), one column
per slice of the real population or, in item mode, per item (or per
answer category of polytomous items). Blue cells hold too many synthetic
respondents or answers, red cells too few, and pale cells are a match or
within what a real sample of the same size would show by chance. On the
right, Overlap (Item Overlap in item mode) and Structure give the mean
(Overall), the worst (Lowest) and the best (Highest) attempt.

## Usage

``` r
gg_coverage(
  x,
  page = 1,
  order = c("worst", "difficulty", "original"),
  items_per_plot = NULL,
  max_columns = 40,
  title = NULL,
  subtitle = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  an `mv_coverage` object from
  [`synthetic_coverage()`](https://www.okanbulut.com/mirtverse/reference/synthetic_coverage.md).

- page:

  with more items than fit on one plot, the page to draw, or `"all"` for
  a list of all pages.

- order:

  item order in item mode: `"worst"` (lowest Item Overlap first),
  `"difficulty"` (real proportion correct or mean, high to low) or
  `"original"`.

- items_per_plot:

  number of items on one page; by default as many as fit in
  `max_columns`.

- max_columns:

  the most columns on one page.

- title, subtitle:

  optional title and subtitle; by default a question that fits the view.

## Value

A patchwork object (a list of them with `page = "all"`).

## Details

In item mode one plot shows at most `max_columns` columns, so the cells
stay readable: 20 right/wrong items, 8 five-point Likert items, 5
seven-point items, and so on. Larger tests are split into pages; by
default the worst-matching items come first. The numbers on the right
always use all items.

## Examples

``` r
set.seed(1)
a <- matrix(rlnorm(10, 0.2, 0.3)); d <- matrix(rnorm(10))
real <- as.data.frame(simdata(a, d, 800, itemtype = "dich"))
llm <- function(mu, s) lapply(1:3, function(i) as.data.frame(
  simdata(a, d, 200, itemtype = "dich", Theta = matrix(rnorm(200, mu, s)))))
cov <- synthetic_coverage(list("LLM A" = llm(0.8, 0.7), "LLM B" = llm(-0.5, 0.9)),
                          real, slices = "item")
gg_coverage(cov)
```
